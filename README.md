# High-Card

## Instructions
Create a browser-based game where a player plays cards against a computer.  

### User Stories/game logic

- The player should be able to draw a card from their hand and then it should be displayed against a computer's card.

- The highest card Wins and they get a point. So the User and Comp should have their scores displayed and updated each turn.

- The game should be at least 10 cards with values from 1 to 10.

- Make sure the cards come out in a different order each time you play the game.


### Setup 

- Check that your index.html and your .js and .css files are all linked up. Change the background from orange and get going.



### Remember the lessons on DOM manipulation you just had, and make sure to use resources such as MDN, StackOverflow, and Google.
