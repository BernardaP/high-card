# High-Card

## Instructions
Create a browser-based game where a player plays cards against a computer.  

### User Stories/game logic

- The player should be able to draw a card from their hand and then it should be displayed against a computer's card.

- The highest card Wins and they get a point. So the User and Comp should have their scores displayed and updated each turn.

- The game should be at least 10 cards with values from 1 to 10.

- Make sure the cards come out in a different order each time you play the game.


### Setup 

- Check that your index.html and your .js and .css files are all linked up. Change the background from orange and get going.


### Steps to consider
 -Create a div with the class of 'container' to contain all of the parts of the game.

 -Create two divs that will show the player card, and the computer card

 -Add divs for the player score, and the computer score

 -Add a button, (or maybe it's a deck) with a 'click' event to allow the player to draw and play a card.

### Functions to consider
<em>These could easily be done with OOP as opposed to functional programming.</em>
-Create a function to reorder the deck randomly
-Create game logic to hold a player, and computer score
-Create function to listen for the 'click event'
-Create functions to determine the winnder of a round
-Create a function to assign the computer, and the player a card
-Do the neccessary DOM manipulation to display the cards played
-Determine game logic to decide ona winner after a predetermined number of plays
